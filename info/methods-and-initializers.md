When the user executes a method access, we’ll find the closure for that method and wrap it in a new “bound method” object that tracks the instance that the method was accessed from. This bound object can be called later like a function. When invoked, the VM will do some shenanigans to wire up this to point to the receiver inside the method’s body.
