Many languages make a distinction between variables that can be reassigned and those that can’t. In Java, the final modifier prevents you from assigning to a variable. In JavaScript, a variable declared with let can be assigned, but one declared using const can’t. Swift treats let as single-assignment and uses var for assignable variables. Scala and Kotlin use val and var.

Pick a keyword for a single-assignment variable form to add to Lox. Justify your choice, then implement it. An attempt to assign to a variable declared using your new keyword should cause a compile error.
