Add some more native functions to do things you find useful. Write some programs using those. What did you add? How do they affect the feel of the language and how practical it is? I will add fileRead

Native function calls are fast in part because we donâ€™t validate that the call passes as many arguments as the function expects. We really should, or an incorrect call to a native function without enough arguments could cause the function to read uninitialized memory. Add arity checking.
